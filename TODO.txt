- Figure out ECC standard curve DTEs
- Sort out details on Z_p^* or QR subgroup DTEs
- Get students implementing simple PAKE using aforementioned DTEs + FTE-based
  DTE_c


- Investigate DTE_c's for statistical attack resistance
    . Computational model approach for general purpose?
    . For particular (sets of) statistical attacks


- Formalizing the primitives further, giving these other constructions for
  dist enc concentrator and Markov chain one


- Details of a simple PAKE protocol
    . Start implementation 


- Start getting transcripts for various analyses
    . Maybe start with FTE paper pcaps?
    .
